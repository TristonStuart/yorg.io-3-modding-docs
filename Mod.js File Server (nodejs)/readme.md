# YOU NEED NODE.JS (https://nodejs.org/en/)

This is a mod file server in node js for Yorg 3 Beta.
Your mod should be accessible here : http://localhost:8000/mod.js
**Your mod needs to be named "mod.js" and in the directory where the server is!**
(If you want to change the mod.js file location, look in the code and change where it points)
